# Prezto â€” Instantly Awesome Zsh

Prezto is a configuration framework for [Zsh][1]; it enriches the command line
interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion,
and prompt themes.

***Note: This version is adjusted to work with my personal [dotfiles](/ezintz/dotfiles). In case you want to use the "standalone" version please use the [original](/sorin-ionescu/prezto) one.***
